You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!\n\n### Example :\n\n```\n['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'\n```\n\n \n\n> Solution\n\n```\nfunction smash(words) {\n  var sentence = words.join(' '); // Join the words with a space in between\n  return sentence;\n}\n\nvar words = ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great'];\nvar result = smash(words);\nconsole.log(result);\n```\n\nLet me explain how the code works:\n\n1.  We define a function called smash that takes an array of words as its parameter.\n2.  Inside the function, we use the join method on the words array. The join method concatenates all the elements of an array into a single string, with the specified separator in between. In this case, we use a space ‘ ‘ as the separator.\n3.  The resulting string is stored in the variable sentence.\n4.  Finally, we return the sentence from the function.\n5.  Outside the function, we create an array called words with the given words.\n6.  We call the smash function with the words array as an argument and store the result in the variable result.\n7.  Finally, we log the result to the console, which will display the sentence.\n\nWhen you run this code, the output will be:\n\n```\nhello world this is great\n```\n\nSo, the function joins all the words in the array together with spaces and returns the resulting sentence.\n","props":{"readingTimeMinutes":1,"description":"> Problem\n\nWrite a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence..."}},"prev":{"title":"Duplicate Encoder","href":"/learn/problem-solving/duplicate-encoder"},"next":{"title":"Count by X","href":"/learn/problem-solving/count-by-x"}},"__N_SSG":true}
