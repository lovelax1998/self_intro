The modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation. If a number is even, it will be perfectly divisible by 2, so its remainder when divided by 2 will be 0. If it's odd, the remainder will be 1.\n\nWe check if number % 2 === 0. If the condition is true (the number is even), we execute the code inside the if block, which returns the string \"Even\".\n\nIf the condition in Step 3 is false (the number is odd), we execute the code inside the else block, which returns the string \"Odd\".\n\nExamples:\n\nLet's call the function with some examples to see how it works:\n\n```\nconsole.log(even_or_odd(5));  // Output: \"Odd\"\nconsole.log(even_or_odd(10)); // Output: \"Even\"\nconsole.log(even_or_odd(0));  // Output: \"Even\"\nconsole.log(even_or_odd(-3)); // Output: \"Odd\"\n```\n\nIn the first example, we pass the number 5 to the function, and it returns \"Odd\" because 5 is an odd number.\n\nIn the second example, we pass the number 10, which is even, so the function returns \"Even\".\n\nIn the third example, we pass 0, which is also an even number, so the function returns \"Even\".\n\nIn the last example, we pass -3, which is an odd number, and the function returns \"Odd\". The function works correctly for negative integers as well.\n\nHope this helps!\n","props":{"readingTimeMinutes":1,"description":"> Problem\n\nCreate a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns \"Even\" for even..."}},"prev":{"title":"Count by X","href":"/learn/problem-solving/count-by-x"},"next":{"title":"Sum without highest and lowest number","href":"/learn/problem-solving/sum-without-highest-and-lowest-number"}},"__N_SSG":true}
