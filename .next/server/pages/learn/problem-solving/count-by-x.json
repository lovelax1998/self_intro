Then, we use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n (inclusive). Inside the loop, we multiply x by the current iteration i and push the result into the result array using the push method. Finally, we return the result array.\n\nFor example, `countBy(1, 10)` would return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, and `countBy(2, 5)` would return `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`.\n","props":{"readingTimeMinutes":1,"description":"> Problem\n\nCreate a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples..."}},"prev":{"title":"Sentence Smash","href":"/learn/problem-solving/sentence-smasher"},"next":{"title":"Even or Odd","href":"/learn/problem-solving/even-or-odd"}},"__N_SSG":true}
