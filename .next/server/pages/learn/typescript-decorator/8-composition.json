In this model, when composing functions f and g, the resulting composite (f âˆ˜ g)(x) is equivalent to f(g(x)).\n\nAs such, the following steps are performed when evaluating multiple decorators on a single declaration in TypeScript:\n\nThe expressions for each decorator are evaluated top-to-bottom.\nThe results are then called as functions from bottom-to-top.\nIf we were to use decorator factories, we can observe this evaluation order with the following example:\n\n```typescript\nfunction first() {\n  console.log(\"first(): factory evaluated\");\n  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n    console.log(\"first(): called\");\n  };\n}\n\nfunction second() {\n  console.log(\"second(): factory evaluated\");\n  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n    console.log(\"second(): called\");\n  };\n}\n\nclass ExampleClass {\n  @first()\n  @second()\n  method() {}\n}\n```\n\nWhich would print this output to the console:\n\n```typescript\nfirst(): factory evaluated\nsecond(): factory evaluated\nsecond(): called\nfirst(): called\n```\n","props":{"readingTimeMinutes":1,"description":"Multiple decorators can be applied to a declaration, for example on a single line:\n\n```typescript..."}},"prev":{"title":"8.
